= Setting up your environment

In your terminal, configure the following environment variables:

[source,terminal]
----
export project_id=$(gcloud config list --format="value(core.project)")
export region=us-east1
export prefix=osd-ngfw
export service_cidr="172.30.0.0/16"
export machine_cidr="10.0.0.0/22"
export pod_cidr="10.128.0.0/14"
----

This example uses `us-east1` as the region to deploy into and the prefix `osd-ngfw` for the cluster's resources. The  default CIDR ranges are assigned for the service and pod networks. The machine CIDR is based on the subnet ranges that will be set later in this tutorial. Modify the parameters to meet your needs.
